# ComponentsDemo

##### Components are the main building block for Angular applications. Each component consists of:

    - An HTML template that declares what renders on the page
    - A TypeScript class that defines behavior
    - A CSS selector that defines how the component is used in a template
    - Optionally, CSS styles applied to the template
